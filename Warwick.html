<h6>Warwick the Blood Hunter</h6>
<p>Warwick was once a man revered for his ability to track down human specimens for the darkest types of scientific research.
 When his ambitions exceeded his physical limits, he drank a dangerous elixir to transform himself into an unstoppable 
 manhunter. His newfound strength bore a heavy price.  Before his transformation, Warwick found his calling in Zaun as a 
 "procurer" of human test subjects. Known for his crafty methods and ruthless determination, people regarded him with a
 cautious mixture of fear and respect. As his reputation grew, so did the demands placed upon him. His clients wanted 
 more rare and dangerous specimens, and they wanted them sooner. To meet their demands, Warwick needed the strength
 that transcended his limited human form. His longtime friend,  Singed, devised a powerful formula. The recipe 
 called for three critical components: silver from the Shadow Isles, the fang of a Balefire dire wolf, and the heart 
 of a celestial being. Warwick tracked down the first two in short order, but the third proved a much greater challenge. 
 He traveled to Ionia to trap  Soraka, a creature believed to be a child of the stars, but she discovered his ploy and 
 drove him away with powerful magic. Unable to tolerate his failure, Warwick returned to Singed disfigured and furious.
 He demanded the chemist's incomplete potion, but Singed warned him that the results would be unpredictable. Ignoring 
 his friend's warning, Warwick drank the concoction. The brew transformed him into a creature both man and wolf, 
 infusing him with raw strength and heightened senses. Exhilarated, he immediately began testing his newfound power. 
 Each day his instincts became sharper, but his human half slipped further away. He could feel himself losing control: 
 though he always got his prey, he often failed to bring them back alive. Now he seeks the blood of Soraka to stabilize 
 his transformation before his mind gives way to the feral urges of the beast.</p>
